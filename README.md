====================
The Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) protocol is defined in 
IEC 61850 for the purpose of distributing event data across entire 
substation networks.  The code in this project can be used to provide
assistance in decoding / encoding GOOSE packets in a programmatic way.

The code is then used to conduct attacks on a GOOSE testbed setup.
